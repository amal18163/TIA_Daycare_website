# TIA_Daycare_website

This is a website my partner and I built as part of our web-development course's final project.  
Our client was The Islamic Academy Daycare. This site is not live (still awaiting content from client).  

NOTE: This is my first attempt at building a website. Works best on Google Chrome. There are a 
couple of formatting issues on Firefox and IE.
